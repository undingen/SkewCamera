Early version. Verify results and keep hands clear while the printer moves. Use at your own risk.

## ‚ú® Features

- Automated Klipper XY skew calibration with a camera and ChArUco board
- Works with Moonraker and HTTP/MJPEG cameras (e.g. crowsnest)
- Stores camera intrinsics to K.npy and dist.npy for reuse
- Prints ready-to-use Klipper command: SET_SKEW XY=...
- Reports observed axis travel for a commanded 100 mm move and if a significant scale error is detected, prints suggested rotation_distance correction factors for X/Y

## üß† How it works

1) Board: Print or use the provided PDFs and tape the ChArUco board flat on the bed (100% scale, no fit-to-page).
2) Guided capture: The tool moves the toolhead and captures images at multiple XY offsets and Z heights to diversify perspective for robust calibration.
3) Intrinsics: OpenCV (CharucoDetector) detects corners across images and calibrates the camera, saving K.npy and dist.npy.
4) Skew solve: With the calibrated camera, the tool collects poses across the bed, estimates the camera‚Äìnozzle offset and an affine map from commanded XY to observed board XY, then emits SET_SKEW parameters for Klipper.
  Additionally, it reports observed axis travel for a 100 mm and when the error is significant, prints rotation_distance correction hints for X and Y.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (Linux recommended)
- Klipper + Moonraker reachable from your host
- A camera reachable via HTTP snapshot/MJPEG (typical crowsnest URL) or a local index supported by OpenCV
- OpenCV: opencv-python>=4.10

Optional (for PDF generation only): Pillow, img2pdf, pikepdf

## üõ†Ô∏è Install

- Create/activate a venv if desired, then install:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Quick start

1) Print the ChArUco board (recommended)

- Open and print either `charuco_A4_5mm.pdf` or `charuco_Letter_5mm.pdf` depending on your paper size.
- Print at 100% scale (Actual Size). Do not use "Fit to page". Tape the sheet flat and square to the bed.
- You do NOT need to run `generate-board` unless you want to regenerate these PDFs yourself.

Optional (regenerate PDFs yourself ‚Äî requires extras):

```bash
skew_correction.py generate-board
```

Experimental: Bambu Lab Vision Encoder board

- You can also try using the original Bambu Lab Vision Encoder board (untested).
- It uses a custom 7x7 ArUco dictionary and has small 2.5 mm fields on a 132√ó128 grid.
- This may require a higher-resolution camera and/or the ability to focus very close.
- Usage:

```bash
# One-time intrinsics (experimental mode):
skew_correction.py calibrate-camera "camera_calibration_imgs/*.jpg" --vision-encoder

# Run skew (experimental mode):
skew_correction.py skew --z 40 --vision-encoder
```

2) Capture images for camera intrinsics (one-time setup)

This moves the toolhead through a guided pattern to capture multiple views and saves images to `camera_calibration_imgs/`. Do this once per camera setup, and only repeat if you change focus, resolution, lens, or the camera mount. Adjust `--camera-id` if your camera URL or index differs.

```bash
skew_correction.py capture-calibration-images \
  --camera-id http://klipper.local/webcam/?action=snapshot
```

3) Calibrate intrinsics and save K.npy / dist.npy (one-time setup)

This reads the captured images, detects ChArUco corners, and computes camera intrinsics. It writes `K.npy` and `dist.npy` for reuse. You typically do this once; future `skew` runs will reuse these files.

```bash
skew_correction.py calibrate-camera "camera_calibration_imgs/*.jpg"
```

4) Run skew calibration and print the Klipper command (repeat as needed)

This captures poses over the bed, estimates camera‚Äìnozzle offset and XY skew, and prints a ready-to-use Klipper command like `SET_SKEW XY=...`. Run this whenever you want to re-check or update skew; it reuses `K.npy` and `dist.npy`.

```bash
skew_correction.py skew --z 40
```

Defaults can be overridden with flags or env vars (see below).

When skew completes, the tool also:
- Reports the observed travel for a 100 mm command along X and Y (assuming the board is printed at 100% scale)
- If the axis scale error is significant, prints a hint with suggested correction factors:
  - Klipper: new rotation_distance = old rotation_distance √ó factor (per-axis)

Note on one-time vs recurring steps:
- Steps 2‚Äì3 (intrinsics capture and calibration) are one-time per camera configuration.
- Step 4 (`skew`) is what you run each time you want updated skew values.

## üîß Command reference

- Regenerate board PDFs (A4, Letter) alteratively use Bambu Vision Encoder board (experimental):
  - `skew_correction.py generate-board`
  - Note: Not required for normal use; the repository already includes `charuco_A4_5mm.pdf` and `charuco_Letter_5mm.pdf` for printing.

- Guided capture for intrinsics:
  - `skew_correction.py capture-calibration-images [--camera-id URL] [--z 40.0] [--margin 10.0] [--dx 20.0] [--dy 20.0] [--moonraker-url URL]`

- Calibrate camera intrinsics from images:
  - `skew_correction.py calibrate-camera "camera_calibration_imgs/*.jpg"`
  - Add `--vision-encoder` to use the experimental Bambu board.

- Skew calibration (prints SET_SKEW command):
  - `skew_correction.py skew [--camera-id URL] [--z 40.0] [--margin 25.0] [--moonraker-url URL]`
  - Add `--vision-encoder` to use the experimental Bambu board.

Environment variables (defaults):
- `PRINTER_URL` = `http://klipper.local`
- Camera URL default = `http://klipper.local/webcam/?action=snapshot`

Running on the printer (localhost):
- If you run this directly on the printer host, set the URL(s) to localhost, e.g.:
  `export PRINTER_URL=http://localhost`
  or
  - `--moonraker-url http://localhost:7125` and 
  - `--camera-id http://localhost/webcam/?action=snapshot` (adjust path to your setup)

## ‚úÖ Tips for best results

- Print the board at 100% scale; tape it flat and square to the bed
- Ensure good, even lighting; avoid glare and motion blur (the tool dwells before capture)
- Capture enough diverse views for intrinsics; the guided flow suggests small tilts between phases
- Reuse your K.npy/dist.npy for future runs unless you change camera focus, mount, or resolution

## üìÇ Files produced

- `K.npy`, `dist.npy`: camera intrinsics saved in the project directory
- `camera_calibration_imgs/`: captured images for intrinsics
